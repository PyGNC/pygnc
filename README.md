# PyGNC

This is the central repository for the PyGNC system and is intended to exist as a large "monorepo" containing many complementary components. The following is a high-level breakdown of the repository.

## Flight

[Flight](https://github.com/PyGNC/pygnc/tree/main/flight)

Everything contained in `flight/` is intended to run on a raspberry pi operating as a secondary processor in coordination with a PyCubed main processor.

## PyCubed Emulator

[PyCubed Emulator](https://github.com/PyGNC/pygnc/tree/main/pycubed_emulator)

This is a julia application that emulates a PyCubed main processor and its interaction with the raspberry pi.

## Scenario Generator

[Scenario Generator](https://github.com/PyGNC/pygnc/tree/main/scenario_generator)

This is a julia application that uses realistic orbit dynamics simulation to generate "scenarios." Scenarios are binary files containing data in the same format the PyCubed processor would generate it in. Currently each scenario consists of one file, `batch_sensor_gps_data.bin` which is a batch of sensor and GPS measurements taken over a long time period and then uploaded to the raspberry pi at once.

## Scenarios

[Scenarios](https://github.com/pygnc/pygnc/tree/main/scenarios)

The scenarios generated by the `scenario_generator` are stored here.

## Test

[test](https://github.com/pygnc/pygnc/tree/main/test)

Unit tests and test scripts for code in `flight` are stored here.
Unit tests can be run by running `nose2` or [`runtests.py`](https://github.com/pygnc/pygnc/tree/main/runtests.py).

## Other contents
The repository also contains convenience scripts for packaging the flight code in a zip file and transferring it to a raspberry pi via scp.
